# network-attacks-ex1


This is the format that the attack detector is accumulating the data in:


```
{
    "ap_mac1":{
        "client1": [],
        "client2": [],
        "client3": [],
        "client4": [],

    },

    "ap_mac2":{
        "client1": [],
        "client2": [],
        "client3": [],
        "client4": [],

    }

}
```
